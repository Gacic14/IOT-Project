IoT-Based Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System
Key Features
✅ Real-Time Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
✅ Visual Alerts with LED Indicators
✅ Firebase Integration
✅ Web Application for Data Visualization

Technologies Used
🔹 Hardware: NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11/DHT22 sensor, LED indicators
🔹 Backend: Firebase Realtime Database
🔹 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Firebase SDK)
🔹 Communication: Wi-Fi

How It Works
📡 Sensor Measures Data: The DHT sensor continuously reads temperature and humidity.
📤 Data is Sent to Firebase: The NodeMCU sends the sensor readings to Firebase in real time.
💡 Visual Alerts: LEDs indicate changes in temperature—green LED for high temperature, red LED for low temperature.
📊 Web Dashboard: A web application displays real-time and historical data.

Live Demo
🌍 The web application is live and accessible at: IoT Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
